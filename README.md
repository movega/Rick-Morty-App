Rick and Morty App

This app allows users to review information about characters, locations and episodes from the Rick and Morty TV show universe.

There are screens that display lists of all characters, locations and episodes. Tapping on an item will show customized details for that character, location or episode.

A search screen has been added, allowing the user to filter results.

The app follows an MVVM architecture for clean separation of concerns. The model classes represent the data, view models handle the business logic and transformations of data for the views, and the views display the UI and get updated by the view models.

The Rick and Morty API at https://rickandmortyapi.com/ was utilized to fetch character, location and episode data to display in the app.
